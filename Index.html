    <h2>A Weekend at Rio</h2>
    <p>Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area and the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site.</p>
    <p>I stayed three days visiting Rio this month! I was able to see many things while we were there!</p>
    <h4 id="day1">Day 1</h4>
    <p>On my first day, I started by visiting <em>Rio Downtown</em> right away. My second stop was the statue of Christ the Redeemer (check out that beautiful picture!).</p>

    <h4 id="day2">Day 2</h4>
    <p>On my second day, I went to visit <em>statue of Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado;</em>. An extremely popular hot spot for tourist, to visit and take pictures. <br /><br />After I admired the view, I went back done from the top of Corcovado, and visited another beautiful mountain overlooking the city of Rio, Such as <em>Sugarloaf Mountain</em>.
      Sugarloaf Mountain, has arguably one of the best views of the city possible, as seen with the pictures. subsequently, I visited <em>Parque Enrique Lage</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="day3">Day 3</h4>
    <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Parque Lage</em>. It's huge! I also went to <em>Visual Arts School of Parque Lage</em>. Seeing the work of series of brazilian television shows, the staging of well-known plays such as Shakespeare's "The Tempest", in person was extremely interesting. I was surprised to see that the museum also
      had many people interested in establishing or deepening their contact with art.</p>
